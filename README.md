# Make you Own Operating System
## Setup of the development environment
### Installing a Linux Vm on Windows
In this book we will extensively use Linux because a lot of compilation command and toold are available by default.
So donâ€™t be upset if you have a Windows machine. There is a solution for using a Linux environment on PC. You can use a program called Virtual Box  that will simulate the environment of an another operating system. This will be very useful later when we are gonna test our Operating System.

####  Installing Vbox
Download the latest version of VirtualBox at the following adress: https://www.virtualbox.org/
Click on the file you've just dowloaded and follow the instruction

#### Installing Virtual Machine
Download image
Starting

#### Installing Qemu
Quemu is a software that will simulate any machine or processor.
>	sudo apt-get install qemu

And say yes if you need to install new pacakages
To test
> qemu-i386  -version

It might write something like that
>qemu-i386 version 2.0.0 (Debian 2.0.0+dfsg-2ubuntu1.34), Copyright (c) 2003-2008 Fabrice Bellard



### Getting the Code and Testing
All the code is stored in a git repository ( a plublic place where everybody can get code)
Ensure that you have git installed
>sudo apt-get install git


Then type:

	git clone https://github.com/fflayol/myownmadeoperatingsystem.git	
	cd code/chapter1	
	sudo apt-get install nasm	
	masm boot.asm -o kernel.sys
	qemu-system-i386  kernel.sys
		
	
Normally you might see a window which print Hello World ! Congratulation

>		   mov ds, ax

Let's explain a bit what this code is doing (we will return to this code later in the next chapter).

	[ORG 0x7c00] 
tells at which adress  the code must be put

	xor ax, ax 
	mov ds, ax 
	mov si, msg
Get the complete adress of the message we want to print (that is to say where the message is stored)

	lodsb
	or al, al  ; zero end of string
	jz hang    ; get out	
Store into **al** the current character of the string and test if it is equal to  zero and exit if this character equals to 0 (in this case 0 not the character 0)

	mov ah, 0x0E
	int 0x10
Call a function (we will see later what is an interuption) to print the character
